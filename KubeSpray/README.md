# KubeSpray

Vary simple inventory file and script to install Kubernetes using KubeSpray <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray>

This inventory assumes that 2 machines (VMs) have already been created and that password-less ssh connection is configured.

The playbook will create a 2-node cluster with one control plane and one worker node.
